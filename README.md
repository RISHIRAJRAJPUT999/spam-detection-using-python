# Spam Mail Detection - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Spam Mail Detection** system built using **Machine Learning** in Google Colab. It classifies emails as spam or not spam (ham) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of email text (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Training using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation using **accuracy score**
- Model deployment-ready for further integration

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available **Spam/Ham email dataset** containing labeled emails. If required, it can be downloaded from sources like **Kaggle or  my Machine Learning Repository**.

## 📜 Libraries Used
The model is implemented using the following libraries:
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **train_test_split**: Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- **TfidfVectorizer**: Converting text data into numerical format
- **LogisticRegression**: Classification model
- **accuracy_score**: Evaluating model performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy:  0.9668161434977578%
